# R_Machine_Learning_Overview

This repository contains a guide to different machine learning concepts using R: logistic regression, random forests, ROC curves, neural networks, K-fold cross validation, etc. Also includes brief data cleaning and analysis discussion. This article is based on the Lending Club dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/creativesoul/lending-club-loan-analysis/?select=lc_loan.csv). I don't update this often, but any comments are welcome. Enjoy!
